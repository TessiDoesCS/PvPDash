## What does this mod do?

You can join a Team by setting a number in the settings. If you are on Team 0, everyone else will count as your enemy.
Every time you dash, red spinners, that stay for three seconds, will be spawned on the screen of your enemies.
You can see the spinners you create as blue, translucent ones on your screen.
If you want even more of a challenge, you can turn on spawning red spinners on your own screen (does also work, if you are not connected to CelesteNet).
To use the multiplayer aspect of this mod, you of course need to be connected to a CelesteNet server.

## How do i get the mod?
It should be on GameBanana.

If you want to build it yourself, you will first need to create a directory in /Source/Ref and put the CelesteNet.Client.dll and CelesteNet.Shared.dll
files from CelesteNet in there.
Then you should be able to run dotnet build --configuration Release to get the zip. If that doesnt work, i recommend using dotnet publish.

If you encounter any issues with this mod, feel free to open an issue or send a message to me on discord, be warned that i am very lazy tho.

## What will be the future of this mod?
idk

If you have any suggestions, feel free to suggest them or send a message to me on discord @leo2k6islazy :D
